MiniGames
=========

Overview
======
A minigame management plugin for Minecraft servers! You can use this plugin in two ways: create premade minigames with high levels of customization, including: game type, score management, player management and other things; or create custom minigames with entirely customizable rulesets, information, and more! While there are many options as to how you want your mini games to function, you can create games on the fly, with preset arenas and gametypes. The customization is endless!
