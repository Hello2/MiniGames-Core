  #This feature uses the CoreProtect API to rollback arenas. This means players can destroy and place
  #blocks at will, and it will be reverted. It requires CoreProtect v2.0.9 or up to use, and some game types
  #(e.g. Siege) require this function. To enable the CoreProtect API, go to your coreprotect plguin's folder
  #and set api-enabled to true. CoreProtect download: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/coreprotect/
