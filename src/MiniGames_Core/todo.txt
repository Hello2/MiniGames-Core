TODO LIST:
1. Code the classes - including API
2. Test plugin
3. Do bugfixing
4. Repeat 2 and 3 until it works
5. Open to public as beta testing
6. Do bugfixing and perfection
7. Repair major errors
8. Ask for suggestions
9. Add suggestions
10. Repeat 1 - 10 until no more suggestions


Add more things here later that are more specific as to what is left in the plugin to code.

Things remaining (that I can think of):

Block protection - Making sure only in game players can edit the arena while it is in game, and arena cannot be edited in any state other than edit (or in game by players in the game)
API methods - creating minigames and a bunch of other things
Minigame creation - add methods to make new minigame types
Configuration - add controllers and such to manage: config.yml, (in arenas folder) <arenaname>.yml, (in minigames folder) <minigamename>.yml
Kit/Class selection - in lobby selection of classes (if minigame has this enabled)
Configuration options - add options that make plugin more controllable
Statistics tracker - tracks wins, losses, kills (if applicable), currency (if applicab;le, global or per minigame), and other things - per minigame (maybe ad per arena function)
Format code to make it nicer, including adding comments
